# Sentiment Analysis with BERT and Python

## Overview
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** using a **BERT Neural Network** and Python. It leverages the pre-trained [nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) model from Hugging Face to score the sentiment of scraped Yelp reviews.

## Features
- **Scrape Yelp Reviews**: Collect real-time data for sentiment analysis.
- **BERT Model Integration**: Use a state-of-the-art transformer model for accurate predictions.
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Classify sentiments into 5 categories:
  - 1 star: Very Negative 😠
  - 2 stars: Negative 😞
  - 3 stars: Neutral 😐
  - 4 stars: Positive 🙂

- **Visualization**: Display the distribution of sentiment scores.

## Model
We use the [nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) model, which can classify text into 1 to 5 star ratings across multiple languages.
